Hi there and welcome! I have been a Ph.D. Student in Statistics and Data Science at [Université de Caen Normandie, France](http://welcome.unicaen.fr/), [Laboratory Mathematics Nicolas Oresme](https://www.lmno.cnrs.fr/) since 2018 where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Faicel Chamroukhi](https://chamroukhi.com/) and ARC DECRA Research Fellow and Senior Lecturer [Hien Duy Nguyen](https://hiendn.github.io/). During my Ph.D. research, I am also very fortunate to collaborate with Professor [Geoff McLachlan](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/GeoffMcLachlan/) focusing in finite mixture models. I received a Visiting PhD Fellowship at the [Inria Grenoble-Rhône-Alpes Research Centre](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes), working with Senior Researcher [Florence Forbes](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/forbes/) and associate researcher [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/) in the [Statify](https://team.inria.fr/statify/) team under a project [LANDER](https://team.inria.fr/statify/projects/LANDER/) (from September 2020 to January 2021).

A central theme of my research focuses on Data Science, at the interface of:
- Statistical learning in high-dimensional and complex data: supervised, unsupervised and visualization of high-dimensional data, model selection in clustering and regression for functional and heterogeneous data, and statistical convergence for deep hierarchical MoE, approximate Bayesian computation. 
- Machine learning: deep generative models (variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks).
- Optimization: robust and effective optimization algorithms for deep neural network and deep hierarchical MoE (stochastic gradient descent, stochastic EM algorithm, MM algorithm), DC algorithm.
