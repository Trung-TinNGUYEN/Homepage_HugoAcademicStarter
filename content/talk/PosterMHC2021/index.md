abstract: Mixture of experts (MoE) is a popular class of models in statistics and machine learning that has sustained attention over the years, due to its flexibility and effectiveness. We consider the Gaussian-gated localized MoE (GLoME) regression model for modeling heterogeneous data. This model poses challenging questions with respect to the statistical estimation and model selection problems, including feature selection, both from the computational and theoretical points of view. We study the problem of estimating the number of components of the GLoME model, in a penalized maximum likelihood estimation framework. We provide a lower bound on the penalty that ensures a weak oracle inequality is satisfied by our estimator. To support our theoretical result, we perform numerical experiments on simulated and real data, which illustrate the performance of our finite-sample oracle inequality.

The program includes talks on statistical methods for mixture models, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, so that the conference should gather specialists from the different communities. The participation of junior researchers as well as PhD students is particularly encouraged. This workshop is organized under the project [**SMILES**](https://smiles.lmno.cnrs.fr/index.html) (Statistical Modeling and Inference for unsupervised Learning at LargE-Scale) funded by the french National Research Agency (ANR). It is also connected to the ex-RIN project [**AStERiCS**](https://asterics.lmno.cnrs.fr/index.html) (Scaled Statistical Learning for Representation and Unsupervised Classification), which was funded by the region Normandy, and the final culmination of which MiMo2020 (cancelled due to Covid-19 crisis) should have been.
