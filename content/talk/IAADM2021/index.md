abstract: Mixtures of experts (MoE) models are a ubiquitous tool for the analysis of heterogeneous data across many fields including statistics, bioinformatics, pattern recognition, economics, and medicine, among many others. They provide conditional constructions for regression in which the mixture weights, along with the component densities, are explained by the predictors,  allowing for flexibility in the modeling of data arising from complex data generating processes. In this work, we consider the Gaussian-gated localized MoE (GLoME) regression model for modeling heterogeneous data. This model poses challenging questions with respect to the statistical estimation and model selection problems both from the computational and theoretical points of view. We study the problem of estimating the number of components of the GLoME model in a penalized maximum likelihood estimation framework. We provide a lower bound on the penalty that ensures a weak oracle inequality is satisfied by our estimator. In particular, these results provide a strong theoretical guarantee, a finite-sample oracle inequality satisfied by the penalized maximum likelihood estimator with a Jensen–Kullback–Leibler type loss, to support the slope heuristic criterion in a finite sample setting, compared to the classical asymptotic criteria.  This allows the calibration of penalty functions,  known up to a multiplicative constant, and to the complexity of the considered random collection of MoE models, including the number of mixture components. To support our theoretical result, we perform numerical experiments on simulated and real data, which illustrate the performance of our finite-sample oracle inequality.

The program includes talks on statistical methods for mixture models, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, so that the conference should gather specialists from the different communities. The participation of junior researchers as well as PhD students is particularly encouraged. This workshop is organized under the project [**SMILES**](https://smiles.lmno.cnrs.fr/index.html) (Statistical Modeling and Inference for unsupervised Learning at LargE-Scale) funded by the french National Research Agency (ANR). It is also connected to the ex-RIN project [**AStERiCS**](https://asterics.lmno.cnrs.fr/index.html) (Scaled Statistical Learning for Representation and Unsupervised Classification), which was funded by the region Normandy, and the final culmination of which MiMo2020 (cancelled due to Covid-19 crisis) should have been.
