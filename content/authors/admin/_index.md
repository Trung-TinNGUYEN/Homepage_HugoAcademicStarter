Hi there and welcome! I am going to be a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in January 2022 at the [Inria Grenoble-Rhône-Alpes Research Centre](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes) where I am very fortunate to be mentored by Senior Researcher [Florence Forbes](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/forbes/), ARC DECRA Research Fellow and Senior Lecturer [Hien Duy Nguyen](https://hiendn.github.io/), and Associate Researcher [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/). I am currently a Ph.D. Student in Statistics and Data Science at [Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, CNRS, LMNO, Caen, France](http://welcome.unicaen.fr/) since 2018 where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Faicel Chamroukhi](https://chamroukhi.com/). During my Ph.D. research, I am also very fortunate to collaborate with Professor [Geoff McLachlan](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/GeoffMcLachlan/) focusing in mixture models. I received a Visiting PhD Fellowship at the [Inria Grenoble-Rhône-Alpes Research Centre](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes), working with Senior Researcher [Florence Forbes](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/forbes/) and Associate Researcher [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/) in the [Statify](https://team.inria.fr/statify/) team under a project [LANDER](https://team.inria.fr/statify/projects/LANDER/) (from September 2020 to January 2021).

A central theme of my research focuses on Data Science, at the interface of:
- Statistical learning: supervised, unsupervised and visualization of high-dimensional data, model selection in clustering and regression for functional and heterogeneous data, statistical convergence for deep hierarchical mixtures of experts (MoE), approximate Bayesian computation.
- Machine learning: deep generative models (variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks), reinforcement learning.
- Optimization: robust and effective optimization algorithms for deep neural network (stochastic gradient descent, Adam,...), deep hierarchical MoE (generalized expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm, EM algorithm, MM algorithm,...), DC algorithm.
- Biostatistics: statistical learning and machine learning for large biological data sets (omics data), e.g., genomics, transcriptomics and proteinomics.
