Hi there and welcome! I am currently a **Postdoctoral Fellow** at the **[Inria Grenoble-Rhône-Alpes](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes)** where I am very fortunate to be mentored by Senior Researcher [Florence Forbes](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/forbes/), Senior Lecturer [Hien Duy Nguyen](https://hiendn.github.io/), and Associate Researcher [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/). I finished my **Ph.D. Degree in Statistics and Data Science** at [Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, CNRS, LMNO, Caen, France](http://welcome.unicaen.fr/) in December 2021 where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Faicel Chamroukhi](https://chamroukhi.com/) and Senior Lecturer [Hien Duy Nguyen](https://hiendn.github.io/). During my Ph.D. research, I am also very fortunate to collaborate with Professor [Geoff McLachlan](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/GeoffMcLachlan/) focusing in mixture models. I received a **Visiting PhD Fellowship** at the [Inria Grenoble-Rhône-Alpes Research Centre](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-grenoble-rhone-alpes), working with Senior Researcher [Florence Forbes](http://mistis.inrialpes.fr/people/forbes/) and Associate Researcher [Julyan Arbel](https://www.julyanarbel.com/) in the [Statify](https://team.inria.fr/statify/) team under a project [LANDER](https://team.inria.fr/statify/projects/LANDER/) (from September 2020 to January 2021).

**A central theme of my research focuses on Data Science**, at the interface of:
- **Statistical learning**: supervised, unsupervised and visualization of high-dimensional data, **model selection** in clustering and regression for functional and heterogeneous data, **statistical convergence for deep hierarchical mixtures of experts (MoE)**, **approximate Bayesian computation**, **Bayesian nonparametrics**.
- **Machine learning**: deep generative models (**variational autoencoders**, generative adversarial networks), reinforcement learning, optimal transport (**Wasserstein distance**).
- **Optimization**: robust and effective optimization algorithms for deep neural network (stochastic gradient descent, Adam,...), deep hierarchical MoE (**expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm, generalized EM algorithm, variational Bayesian EM algorithm, majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm**), DC algorithm.
- **Biostatistics**: statistical learning and machine learning for large biological data sets (omics data), e.g., genomics, transcriptomics and proteinomics.
